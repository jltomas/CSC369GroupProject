# Results:

Our analysis disproved some of our predictions, confirmed other ideas, and provided facts we did not know beforehand.

# Hadoop

* Hadoop Spark was very useful in helping us analyze our data set. 
* The dataset contains all of the 911 call information from several years worth of data, so processing it linearly would have been incredibly slow. 
* Analyzing and printing the data took 6 seconds on the cluster, while locally it generally took over 30s
